class Resolvable(Generic[T]):
    """
    The Resolvable class is the base class for all resolvable entities.
    Resolvable entities are used to represent parameters in the API.
    This class bridges the user intent expressed in natural language and expected objects in the API.
    For exmaple, Contact, Location, DateTime, etc. are all resolvable entities.
    Resolvable objects are resolve from the user input or from entities recieved from the API.

        """
        This class method resolves a resolvable object from the user input.
        The resolved text will usually be a phrase within the user instruction.
        For exmaple:
            * "To San Francisco" will resolve to a Location object.
            * "After 8PM" will resolve to a DateTime object.
            * "To my cousin John" will resolve to a Contact object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        text : str
            The text to recover a Resolvable object from

        This class method resolves a list of resolvable object from the user input.
        The resolved text will usually be a phrase within the user instruction. Resolve from many will usually
        include a plural form of a noun. Alternatively, it will include a singular noun with a semantics of plural.
        For example:
            * "Every store in 10 miles radius" will resolve to a list Location objects.
            * "The weekend" will be resolved to a list of DateTime objects.
            * "My book reading club" will resolve to a list Contact object.

        ----------
        text : str

        This class method resolves a resolvable object from an entity object.
        It is possible that we would like to resolve a one resolvable object from another resolvable object.
        This scenario is typical when using a result of a previous API call as a parameter for a subsequent API call.
        For example:
            * "find directions to San Francisco and send them to John". The navigation directions result will be resolved
            to a Content object in the subsequent API call to send a message.
            * "Find the nearest open pharmacy and navigate to it". The map object will be resolve to a Location object
            in the subsequent API call to navigate to it.

        Parameters
        ----------
        entity : Entity
            The entity object to recover a Resolvable object from
